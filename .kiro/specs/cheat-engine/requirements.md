# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CheatEngine is a macOS educational tool that demonstrates modern operating system memory management through process introspection and memory visualization. The system allows users to attach to their own applications, scan virtual memory regions, and observe variable changes in real time using Mach kernel APIs.

## Glossary

- **CheatEngine**: The main application system for memory analysis and visualization
- **Target_Process**: A user-owned process that CheatEngine attaches to for memory analysis
- **Memory_Scanner**: The subsystem responsible for scanning and analyzing process memory
- **Memory_Region**: A contiguous block of virtual memory with specific protection flags
- **Value_Monitor**: The component that tracks changes to specific memory locations over time
- **Mach_VM_API**: The macOS kernel interface for virtual memory operations

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a systems engineer, I want to attach to my own running processes, so that I can analyze their memory layout and understand virtual memory management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a process ID, THE CheatEngine SHALL validate process ownership before attachment
2. THE CheatEngine SHALL use task_for_pid to obtain process task port for memory operations
3. IF the target process is not owned by the current user, THEN THE CheatEngine SHALL display an access denied error
4. THE CheatEngine SHALL maintain the task port connection until explicitly detached by the user
5. WHEN attachment succeeds, THE CheatEngine SHALL display basic process information including PID and executable path

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enumerate and visualize memory regions of attached processes, so that I can understand how the operating system organizes virtual memory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CheatEngine SHALL enumerate all memory regions using mach_vm_region API calls
2. WHEN scanning memory regions, THE Memory_Scanner SHALL retrieve protection flags for each region
3. THE CheatEngine SHALL display memory regions with their start address, size, and protection attributes
4. THE CheatEngine SHALL categorize regions by type (stack, heap, code, data, shared libraries)
5. WHILE displaying memory layout, THE CheatEngine SHALL show regions in ascending address order

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a reverse engineer, I want to search for specific integer and floating-point values in process memory, so that I can locate variables and data structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies a search value, THE Memory_Scanner SHALL scan readable memory regions for exact matches
2. THE Memory_Scanner SHALL support searching for 32-bit and 64-bit integers and floating-point values
3. THE CheatEngine SHALL use mach_vm_read_overwrite for efficient memory content retrieval
4. THE Memory_Scanner SHALL implement chunked reading to minimize system call overhead
5. WHEN matches are found, THE CheatEngine SHALL display memory addresses and surrounding context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to monitor memory locations for value changes over time, so that I can observe dynamic behavior and variable updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects memory addresses to monitor, THE Value_Monitor SHALL track changes at those locations
2. THE Value_Monitor SHALL periodically read monitored addresses and detect value modifications
3. WHEN a monitored value changes, THE CheatEngine SHALL log the old value, new value, and timestamp
4. THE CheatEngine SHALL display a real-time view of monitored memory locations and their current values
5. THE Value_Monitor SHALL allow users to add and remove addresses from the monitoring list

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a debugging specialist, I want to modify memory values in my own processes for testing purposes, so that I can validate application behavior under different conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE memory modification is enabled, THE CheatEngine SHALL allow writing new values to specified addresses
2. THE CheatEngine SHALL use mach_vm_write to update memory contents safely
3. WHEN writing to memory, THE Memory_Scanner SHALL verify the target region has write permissions
4. IF a write operation fails due to protection violations, THEN THE CheatEngine SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. THE CheatEngine SHALL log all memory write operations with addresses, old values, and new values

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an educator, I want the tool to demonstrate memory management concepts clearly, so that students can learn about virtual memory and process introspection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CheatEngine SHALL provide clear visual representation of memory layout and regions
2. THE CheatEngine SHALL display memory protection flags in human-readable format
3. WHEN showing memory operations, THE CheatEngine SHALL explain the underlying Mach kernel APIs being used
4. THE CheatEngine SHALL include educational tooltips and explanations for memory management concepts
5. THE CheatEngine SHALL demonstrate CPU cache locality principles through memory access patterns
